Ports common service and risks

Port 53/tcp – DNS (Domain Name System)

**IP Address:** 192.168.1.1
**Service:** domain

**Usage:**
This port is used for DNS services, which are responsible for translating domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses. In this case, it's likely used by the router or a local DNS server (manufacturer appears to be ZTE).

**Possible Risks:**

* If the DNS server allows queries from outside the network, it could be abused in amplification attacks.
* If zone transfers (AXFR) are not properly secured, attackers might get access to internal domain information.
* There's also a risk of cache poisoning if DNS responses aren't validated correctly.


Port 80/tcp – HTTP (Web Access)

**IP Address:** 192.168.1.1
**Service:** http

**Usage:**
This port is commonly used for accessing web-based interfaces, such as the login page of routers or other network devices.

**Possible Risks:**

* Data sent over HTTP is not encrypted, so things like login credentials can be intercepted.
* If the device uses default or weak login credentials, it's an easy target.
* Older routers may have outdated or vulnerable web interfaces that can be exploited.


Port 88/tcp – Kerberos Authentication

**IP Address:** 192.168.1.152
**Service:** kerberos-sec

**Usage:**
Kerberos is typically used in Windows environments, especially in domains where centralized authentication is required. This port usually indicates an authentication server or domain controller.

**Possible Risks:**

* Attackers might try to guess passwords or perform brute-force attacks.
* If someone gains access to the key distribution server, they might be able to forge authentication tickets.
* There’s also a chance that domain or user info could be exposed if services are misconfigured.
