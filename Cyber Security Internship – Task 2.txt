Objective: 
Analyze suspicious email samples and identify phishing traits using manual inspection and tools like header analyzers.

Content: Claims a refund of ₹12,380 and asks for bank details through an external link.  

Phishing Indicators:
Spoofed Email Address: Looks official but uses a domain (.gov) that is invalid for India (should be .gov.in).  

Fake Website Link: http://taxrefund-india.info is not a government domain.  

Urgency and Reward: Mentions a specific refund amount to grab attention.  

Generic Greeting: “Dear Taxpayer” suggests a mass phishing attempt.  

Grammar: Contains slight formatting errors.  

Email 2: "Work From Home – Immediate Hiring"
From: careers@amaz0n-jobs.com  

Subject: Work From Home – Immediate Hiring  

Content: Offers a remote job at Amazon for ₹50,000 a month with no experience required.  

Phishing Indicators:  
Misspelled Domain: “amaz0n” uses a zero instead of an “o.”  

Unrealistic Offer: High pay, no experience, and an urgent tone.  

Suspicious URL: http://fakejoboffer.com is a phishing trap.

Phishing Indicators:
